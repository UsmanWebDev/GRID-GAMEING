        <span>WHY KNOW ?</span>
        <h2>GRID has opened up the possibility of using games to educate, engage and empower people in all aspects of
            their lives irrespective of where they live.
        </h2>

        <p>We are at the cusp of the next big technology boom: the global penetration of smartphones. With 3.2 billion
            smartphone users worldwide and a global population of about 7.7 billion, the global smartphone penetration
            has
            reached 41.5 percent and is expected to grow exponentially over the next 5 years. We are looking at a world
            where smartphones as low as $20 are now available in areas where even toilets are a luxury. This boom opens
            a
            window of opportunity, to reach the poor through their phones and use simple mobile games as tools for
            behavior
            change. GRID is mainstreaming games in the social sector, not only in the US but also globally. By creating
            context-vigilant games (in local languages) for low-end smartphones, GRID has opened up the possibility of
            using
            games to educate, engage and empower people in all aspects of their lives irrespective of where they live.
